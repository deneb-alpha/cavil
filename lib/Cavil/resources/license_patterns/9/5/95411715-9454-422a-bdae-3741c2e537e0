Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable\r\nprovided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\r\nProgram. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content,\r\nconstitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by\r\ncopyright law.\r\n\r\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license\r\notherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make\r\nmodifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply\r\nwith the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or\r\nrunning the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms\r\nthat prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not\r\nallowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling\r\nobligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\r\nrestricting circumvention of such measures.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the\r\nextent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you\r\ndisclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\r\n\r\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating\r\nthat this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all\r\nnotices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection\r\nfor a fee.\r\n\r\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source\r\ncode under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n  • a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n  • b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added\r\n    under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\r\n  • c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.\r\n    This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,\r\n    and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any\r\n    other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n  • d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the\r\n    Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do\r\n    so.\r\n\r\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of\r\nthe covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage\r\nor distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit\r\nthe access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered\r\nwork in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey\r\nthe machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\r\n\r\n  • a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),\r\n    accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software\r\n    interchange.\r\n  • b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),\r\n    accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or\r\n    customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the\r\n    Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically\r\n    performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\r\n    charge.\r\n  • c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding\r\n    Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code\r\n    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\r\n  • d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent\r\n    access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not\r\n    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object\r\n    code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying\r\n    where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain\r\n    obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n  • e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code\r\n    and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System\r\nLibrary, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used\r\nfor personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In\r\ndetermining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a\r\nparticular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of\r\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or\r\nexpects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\r\nsubstantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of\r\nthe product.\r\n\r\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information\r\nrequired to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its\r\nCorresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code\r\nis in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\r\n\r\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the\r\nconveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\r\nto the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this\r\nrequirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on\r\nthe User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\r\n\r\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support\r\nservice, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"95411715-9454-422a-bdae-3741c2e537e0"}
