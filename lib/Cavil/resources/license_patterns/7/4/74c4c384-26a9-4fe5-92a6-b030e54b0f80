For instance, many Java programs\r\ndepend on some non-free Java libraries.  To recommend or promote such\r\na program is to promote the other programs it needs.  This is why we\r\nare careful about listing Java programs in the Free Software\r\nDirectory: we don't want to promote the non-free Java libraries.\r\n\r\nWe hope this particular problem with Java will be gone by and by, as\r\nwe replace the remaining non-free standard Java libraries with free\r\nsoftware, but the general principle will remain the same: don't\r\nrecommend, promote or legitimize programs that depend on non-free\r\nsoftware to run.\r\n\r\nSome free programs strongly encourage the use of non-free software.  A\r\ntypical example is @command{mplayer}.  It is free software in itself,\r\nand the free code can handle some kinds of files.
