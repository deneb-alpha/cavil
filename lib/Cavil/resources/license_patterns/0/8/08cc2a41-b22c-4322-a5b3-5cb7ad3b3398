Make the same adjustment\r\n   to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license\r\n   notice of the combined work.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n  <para>\r\n   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\r\n   <quote>History<\/quote> in the various original documents, forming one\r\n   section Entitled <quote>History<\/quote>; likewise combine any sections\r\n   Entitled <quote>Acknowledgements<\/quote>, and any sections Entitled\r\n   <quote>Dedications<\/quote>. You must delete all sections Entitled\r\n   <quote>Endorsements<\/quote>.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n <\/sect2>\r\n\r\n <sect2>\r\n  <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<\/title>\r\n  <para>\r\n   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\r\n   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\r\n   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\r\n   the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\r\n   verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n  <para>\r\n   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\r\n   it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\r\n   License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other\r\n   respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n <\/sect2>\r\n\r\n <sect2>\r\n  <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<\/title>\r\n  <para>\r\n   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\r\n   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\n   distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the\r\n   copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal\r\n   rights of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works\r\n   permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does\r\n   not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\r\n   derivative works of the Document.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n  <para>\r\n   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies\r\n   of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\r\n   aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that\r\n   bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent\r\n   of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must\r\n   appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n <\/sect2>\r\n\r\n <sect2>\r\n  <title>TRANSLATION<\/title>\r\n  <para>\r\n   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\r\n   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\r\n   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from\r\n   their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\r\n   Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these\r\n   Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and\r\n   all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,\r\n   provided that you also include the original English version of this\r\n   License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In\r\n   case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version\r\n   of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\r\n   prevail.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n  <para>\r\n   If a section in the Document is Entitled <quote>Acknowledgements<\/quote>,\r\n   <quote>Dedications<\/quote>, or <quote>History<\/quote>, the requirement\r\n   (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\r\n   changing the actual title.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n <\/sect2>\r\n\r\n <sect2>\r\n  <title>TERMINATION<\/title>\r\n  <para>\r\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\r\n   as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,\r\n   modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\r\n   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\r\n   who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\r\n   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\r\n   compliance.\r\n  <\/para>\r\n <\/sect2>\r\n\r\n <sect2>\r\n  <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<\/title>\r\n  <para>\r\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\r\n   Free Documentation License from time to time.
