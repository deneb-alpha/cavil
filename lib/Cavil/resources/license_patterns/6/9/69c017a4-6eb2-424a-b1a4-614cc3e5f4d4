You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any \\\r\nportion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy \\\r\nand distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section \\\r\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices \\\r\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that \\\r\nin whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or \\\r\nany part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all \\\r\nthird parties under the terms of this License.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively \\\r\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such \\\r\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an \\\r\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a \\\r\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you \\\r\nprovide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program \\\r\nunder these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy \\\r\nof this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is \\\r\ninteractive but does not normally print such an announcement, \\\r\nyour work based on the Program is not required to print an \\\r\nannouncement.)\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If \\\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, \\\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in \\\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those \\\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you \\\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work \\\r\nbased on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the \\\r\nterms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend \\\r\nto the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of \\\r\nwho wrote it.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or \\\r\ncontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the \\\r\nintent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of \\\r\nderivative or collective works based on the Program.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the \\\r\nProgram with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a \\\r\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other \\\r\nwork under the scope of this License.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, \\\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms \\\r\nof Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the \\\r\nfollowing:\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable \\\r\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of \\\r\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software \\\r\ninterchange; or,\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three \\\r\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your \\\r\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete \\\r\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be \\\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a \\\r\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the \\\r\noffer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This \\\r\nalternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and \\\r\nonly if you received the program in object code or executable \\\r\nform with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for \\\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source \\\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any \\\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to \\\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as \\\r\na special exception, the source code distributed need not include \\\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary \\\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the \\\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component \\\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering \\\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent \\\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as \\\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not \\\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program \\\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt \\\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is \\\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this \\\r\nLicense.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from \\\r\nyou under this License will not have their licenses terminated so \\\r\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not \\\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or \\\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are \\\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by \\\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the \\\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and \\\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying \\\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on \\\r\nthe Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from \\\r\nthe original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program \\\r\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any \\\r\nfurther restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights \\\r\ngranted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by \\\r\nthird parties to this License.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of \\\r\npatent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent \\\r\nissues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, \\\r\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this \\\r\nLicense, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. \\\r\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your \\\r\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, \\\r\nthen as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. \\\r\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free \\\r\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies \\\r\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could \\\r\nsatisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from \\\r\ndistribution of the Program.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable \\\r\nunder any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is \\\r\nintended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in \\\r\nother circumstances.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any \\\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any \\\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the \\\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is \\\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made \\\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed \\\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that \\\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is \\\r\nwilling to distribute software through any other system and a \\\r\nlicensee cannot impose that choice.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed \\\r\nto be a consequence of the rest of this License.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in \\\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, \\\r\nthe original copyright holder who places the Program under this \\\r\nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \\\r\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in \\\r\nor among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License \\\r\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this \\\r\nLicense.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new \\\r\nversions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new \\\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may \\\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the \\\r\nProgram specifies a version number of this License which applies to \\\r\nit and \\\"any later version\\\", you have the option of following the \\\r\nterms and conditions either of that version or of any later version \\\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not \\\r\nspecify a version number of this License, you may choose any version \\\r\never published by the Free Software Foundation.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other \\\r\nfree programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to \\\r\nthe author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted \\\r\nby the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software \\\r\nFoundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision \\\r\nwill be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all \\\r\nderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and \\\r\nreuse of software generally.\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n                             NO WARRANTY\\\r\n\", \"\\\r\n  11.
