To rectify this error, you need to include this\r\ninformation in the <em>Cargo.toml<\/em> file.<\/p>\r\n<p>Add a description that is just a sentence or two, because it will appear with\r\nyour crate in search results. For the <code>license<\/code> field, you need to give a\r\n<em>license identifier value<\/em>. The <a href=\"http:\/\/spdx.org\/licenses\/\">Linux Foundation’s Software Package Data\r\nExchange (SPDX)<\/a> lists the identifiers you can use for this value.

Many people in the Rust community license their projects in the\r\nsame way as Rust by using a dual license of <code>MIT OR Apache-2.0<\/code>.
