Only one passage of\r\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\r\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\r\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\r\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\r\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\r\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\r\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\r\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n@item\r\nCOMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\r\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\r\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\r\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\r\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\r\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\r\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\r\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\r\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\r\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\r\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\r\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''\r\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\r\n``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',\r\nand any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all\r\nsections Entitled ``Endorsements.''\r\n\r\n@item\r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\r\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\r\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\r\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\r\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\r\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\r\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\r\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\r\n\r\n@item\r\nAGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\r\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\ndistribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright\r\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\r\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\r\nWhen the Document is included an aggregate, this License does not\r\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\r\nderivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\r\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\r\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\r\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\r\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\r\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\r\naggregate.\r\n\r\n@item\r\nTRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\r\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\r\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\r\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\r\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\r\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\r\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\r\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\r\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\r\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\r\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\r\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',\r\n``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\r\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n@item\r\nTERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\r\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\r\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.
