Both covers must also\r\n      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these\r\n      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all\r\n      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\r\n      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes\r\n      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\r\n      <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> and satisfy these\r\n      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\r\n      respects.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n\r\n    <para>\r\n      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\r\n      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\r\n      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\r\n      adjacent pages.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n\r\n    <para>\r\n      If you publish or distribute <link\r\n      linkend=\"fdl-transparent\">Opaque<\/link> copies of the <link\r\n      linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> numbering more than 100,\r\n      you must either include a machine-readable <link\r\n      linkend=\"fdl-transparent\">Transparent<\/link> copy along with\r\n      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\r\n      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a\r\n      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added\r\n      material, which the general network-using public has access to\r\n      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network\r\n      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take\r\n      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\r\n      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\r\n      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\r\n      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly\r\n      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the\r\n      public.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n\r\n    <para>\r\n      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors\r\n      of the <link linkend=\"fdl-document\">Document<\/link> well before\r\n      redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance\r\n      to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\r\n    <\/para>\r\n    <\/sect1>\r\n\r\n  <sect1 id=\"fdl-section4\">\r\n    <title>4.
