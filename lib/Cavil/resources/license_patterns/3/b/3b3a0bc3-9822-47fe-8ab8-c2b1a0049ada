Is this a risk to author(s)?\r\nThe few utilities that can extract fonts embedded in a PDF will typically output limited amounts of outlines - not a \r\ncomplete font. To create a working font from this method is much more difficult and time consuming than finding the \r\nsource of the original OFL font. So there is little chance that an OFL font would be extracted and redistributed inappropriately \r\nthrough this method. Even so, copyright laws address any misrepresentation of authorship. All Font Software released \r\nunder the OFL and marked as such by the author(s) is intended to remain under this license regardless of the distribution \r\nmethod, and cannot be redistributed under any other license. We strongly discourage any font extraction - we recommend \r\ndirectly using the font sources instead - but if you extract font outlines from a document, please be considerate: use \r\nyour common sense and respect the work of the author(s) and the licensing model","risk":0,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"3b3a0bc3-9822-47fe-8ab8-c2b1a0049ada"}
