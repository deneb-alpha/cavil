Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public\r\nLicense which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means\r\nin particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared\r\nlibrary, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static\r\nlibrary or use modified versions of `libintl'.\r\n   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle\r\nthe use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The\r\nFree Translation Project is also available for packages which are not\r\ndeveloped inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above\r\napplies also for every other Free Software Project.
