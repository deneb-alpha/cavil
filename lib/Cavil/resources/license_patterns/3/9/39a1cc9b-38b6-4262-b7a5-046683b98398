{"license":"","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\nwritten in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\r\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\r\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\nand reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\r\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\nAND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR","risk":5,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"39a1cc9b-38b6-4262-b7a5-046683b98398"}
