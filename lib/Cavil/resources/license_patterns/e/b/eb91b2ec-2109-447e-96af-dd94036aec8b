A pragma\r\n``License``, which is a configuration pragma that typically appears at\r\nthe start of a source file or in a separate :file:`gnat.adc` file, specifies\r\nthe licensing conditions of a unit as follows:\r\n\r\n* Unrestricted\r\n  This is used for a unit that can be freely used with no license restrictions.\r\n  Examples of such units are public domain units, and units from the Ada\r\n  Reference Manual.\r\n\r\n* GPL\r\n  This is used for a unit that is licensed under the unmodified GPL, and which\r\n  therefore cannot be ``with``\\ ed by a restricted unit.\r\n\r\n* Modified_GPL\r\n  This is used for a unit licensed under the GNAT modified GPL that includes\r\n  a special exception paragraph that specifically permits the inclusion of\r\n  the unit in programs without requiring the entire program to be released\r\n  under the GPL.\r\n\r\n* Restricted\r\n  This is used for a unit that is restricted in that it is not permitted to\r\n  depend on units that are licensed under the GPL.  Typical examples are\r\n  proprietary code that is to be released under more restrictive license\r\n  conditions.  Note that restricted units are permitted to ``with`` units\r\n  which are licensed under the modified GPL (this is the whole point of the\r\n  modified GPL).\r\n\r\n\r\nNormally a unit with no ``License`` pragma is considered to have an\r\nunknown license, and no checking is done.  However, standard GNAT headers\r\nare recognized, and license information is derived from them as follows.\r\n\r\nA GNAT license header starts with a line containing 78 hyphens.  The following\r\ncomment text is searched for the appearance of any of the following strings.\r\n\r\nIf the string 'GNU General Public License' is found, then the unit is assumed\r\nto have GPL license, unless the string 'As a special exception' follows, in\r\nwhich case the license is assumed to be modified GPL","risk":0,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"eb91b2ec-2109-447e-96af-dd94036aec8b"}
