{"license":"","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\n     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under\r\n     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December\r\n     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of\r\n     such measures.\r\n\r\n     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\n     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such\r\n     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License\r\n     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention\r\n     to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of\r\n     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal\r\n     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\n     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\n     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\n     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\n     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the\r\n     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and\r\n     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\n     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\n     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\n     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\r\n     conditions:\r\n\r\n       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you\r\n          modified it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n          released under this License and any conditions added under\r\n          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in\r\n          section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable\r\n          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all\r\n          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License\r\n          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but\r\n          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately\r\n          received it","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"efa8b7e4-480c-41cb-a585-3940160b49bb"}
