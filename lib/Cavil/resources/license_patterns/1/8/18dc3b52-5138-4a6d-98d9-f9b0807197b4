Only one\r\n     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\r\n     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.

COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n     You may combine the Document with other documents released under\r\n     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for\r\n     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination\r\n     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\r\n     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your\r\n     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all\r\n     their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\n     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\n     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\r\n     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\r\n     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique\r\n     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the\r\n     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a\r\n     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in\r\n     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\r\n     combined work.\r\n\r\n     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled\r\n     \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section\r\n     Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled\r\n     \"Acknowledgements,\" and any sections Entitled \"Dedications.\"  You\r\n     must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\"\r\n\r\n  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\r\n     documents released under this License, and replace the individual\r\n     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\r\n     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the\r\n     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the\r\n     documents in all other respects.\r\n\r\n     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and\r\n     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert\r\n     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow\r\n     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of\r\n     that document.\r\n\r\n  7.

When the Document is included in an aggregate, this\r\n     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which\r\n     are not themselves derivative works of the Document","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"18dc3b52-5138-4a6d-98d9-f9b0807197b4"}
