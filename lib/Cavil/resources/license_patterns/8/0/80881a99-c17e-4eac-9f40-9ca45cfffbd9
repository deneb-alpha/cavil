Although libfec is a fantastic library, the state of LGPL-licensed libraries \r\non mobile devices is somewhat uncertain. For this reason, libcorrect is a completely new approach under the BSD license \r\nwhich supports the same algorithms as libfec. Additionally, libcorrect can be built with a compatibility layer so that \r\nlibcorrect can be linked in place of libfec.\r\n\r\n    Achieving this goal gives [libquiet](https:\/\/github.com\/quiet\/quiet) a fully BSD-\/MIT-licensed set of dependencies, \r\nwhich gives libquiet more flexibility in mobile applications","risk":0,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"80881a99-c17e-4eac-9f40-9ca45cfffbd9"}
