To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n====================\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other\r\n     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\n     License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and\r\n     “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n     To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the\r\n     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the\r\n     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified\r\n     version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\r\n\r\n     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work\r\n     based on the Program.\r\n\r\n     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\n     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\n     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on\r\n     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes\r\n     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making\r\n     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as\r\n     well.\r\n\r\n     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\n     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\r\n     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\r\n     conveying.\r\n\r\n     An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”\r\n     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\n     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\n     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\r\n     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\r\n     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this\r\n     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or\r\n     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this\r\n     criterion","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"870ec017-ce01-49b4-9e52-dd9aeb19e1d3"}
