{"license":"","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are\r\n     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice\r\n     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A\r\n     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may\r\n     be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\n     A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\r\n     represented in a format whose specification is available to the\r\n     general public, that is suitable for revising the document\r\n     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images\r\n     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some\r\n     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to\r\n     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of\r\n     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an\r\n     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of\r\n     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent\r\n     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is\r\n     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A\r\n     copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\r\n\r\n     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\r\n     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,\r\n     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and\r\n     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for\r\n     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include\r\n     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that\r\n     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or\r\n     XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally\r\n     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF\r\n     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\n     The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\r\n     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\r\n     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For\r\n     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title\r\n     Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the\r\n     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\n     A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document\r\n     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses\r\n     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ\r\n     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as\r\n     \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)\r\n     To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the\r\n     Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according\r\n     to this definition","risk":1,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"814119a6-353c-49eb-8875-23d9e795ff7b"}
