If the Program as\r\n     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that\r\n     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further\r\n     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document\r\n     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\r\n     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed\r\n     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further\r\n     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\n     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\n     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\n     where to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in\r\n     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\n     the above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\n     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\n     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\r\n     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the\r\n     third paragraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\n     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\n     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\n     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the\r\n     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some\r\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\n     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\n     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\n     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from\r\n     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days\r\n     after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate\r\n     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you\r\n     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not\r\n     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses\r\n     for the same material under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\n     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\n     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\r\n     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\r\n     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you\r\n     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions\r\n     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,\r\n     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your\r\n     acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\n     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\n     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not\r\n     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n     An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\r\n     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"201bb121-8c7e-42b0-a294-bfc1f6b3c3e8"}
