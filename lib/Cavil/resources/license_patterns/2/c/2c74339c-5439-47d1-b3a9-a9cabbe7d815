For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the\r\n        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\r\n        the rights granted under this License;\r\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\r\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\r\n        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right\r\n        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\r\n        under this License; and,\r\n    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\r\n        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a\r\n        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\r\n        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\r\n        granted under this License.\r\n\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\r\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\r\nmodifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other\r\nmedia and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by\r\nLicensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\r\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of\r\n    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\r\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\r\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on\r\n    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the\r\n    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\r\n    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must\r\n    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\r\n    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\r\n    When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any\r\n    effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\r\n    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that\r\n    recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the\r\n    Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the\r\n    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\r\n    this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\r\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\r\n    required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon\r\n    notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\r\n    the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\r\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms\r\n    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same\r\n    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction\r\n    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same\r\n    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));\r\n    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation\r\n    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms\r\n    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of\r\n    the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"),\r\n    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the\r\n    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the\r\n    Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or\r\n    Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the\r\n    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\r\n    of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that\r\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep\r\n    intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the\r\n    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the\r\n    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or\r\n    Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective\r\n    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a\r\n    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that\r\n    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)\r\n    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\r\n    not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made\r\n    subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\r\n c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\r\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4\r\n    (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable\r\n    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original\r\n    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and\/or if the Original\r\n    Author and\/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\r\n    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\r\n    Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other\r\n    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the\r\n    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\r\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\r\n    URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the\r\n    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an\r\n    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation\r\n    (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay","risk":3,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"2c74339c-5439-47d1-b3a9-a9cabbe7d815"}
