There are countless other licenses that place specific\r\nrestrictions on code reuse, but there is an important difference to be\r\nconsidered in the GPL and BSD variants.  The best known and perhaps\r\nmost widely used license is the GPL, which in addition to granting you\r\nfull rights to the source code including redistribution, carries with\r\nit an extra obligation. If you use GPL code in your own code, or link\r\nwith it, your product must be released under a GPL compatible\r\nlicense. i.e., you are required to give the source code to other\r\npeople and give them the right to redistribute it as well. Many of the\r\nmost famous and widely used open source projects are released under\r\nthe GPL, including linux, gcc, emacs and sage.\r\n\r\nThe second major class are the BSD-style licenses (which includes MIT\r\nand the python PSF license). These basically allow you to do whatever\r\nyou want with the code: ignore it, include it in your own open source\r\nproject, include it in your proprietary product, sell it,\r\nwhatever. python itself is released under a BSD compatible license, in\r\nthe sense that, quoting from the PSF license page::\r\n\r\n    There is no GPL-like \"copyleft\" restriction. Distributing\r\n    binary-only versions of Python, modified or not, is allowed. There\r\n    is no requirement to release any of your source code. You can also\r\n    write extension modules for Python and provide them only in binary\r\n    form.\r\n\r\nFamous projects released under a BSD-style license in the permissive\r\nsense of the last paragraph are the BSD operating system, python and\r\nTeX.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why early Matplotlib developers selected a\r\nBSD compatible license. Matplotlib is a python extension, and we\r\nchoose a license that was based on the python license (BSD\r\ncompatible).  Also, we wanted to attract as many users and developers\r\nas possible, and many software companies will not use GPL code in\r\nsoftware they plan to distribute, even those that are highly committed\r\nto open source development, such as `enthought\r\n<https:\/\/www.enthought.com>`_, out of legitimate concern that use of the\r\nGPL will \"infect\" their code base by its viral nature. In effect, they\r\nwant to retain the right to release some proprietary code. Companies\r\nand institutions who use Matplotlib often make significant\r\n","risk":0,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b2dd4eb3-9aa5-47f7-97b5-5c7f951d303b"}
