This should be\r\nenforced with a simple programmatic check.  For GCC, again for\r\nexample, a plug-in must define the global symbol\r\n@code{plugin_is_GPL_compatible}, thus asserting that the plug-in is\r\nreleased under a GPL-compatible license (@pxref{Plugins,, Plugins,\r\ngccint, GCC Internals}).\r\n\r\nBy adding this check to your program you are not creating a new legal\r\nrequirement.  The GPL itself requires plug-ins to be free software,\r\nlicensed compatibly.  As long as you have followed the first rule above\r\nto keep plug-ins closely tied to your original program, the GPL and AGPL\r\nalready require those plug-ins to be released under a compatible\r\nlicense.  The symbol definition in the plug-in---or whatever equivalent\r\nworks best in your program---makes it harder for anyone who might\r\ndistribute proprietary plug-ins to legally defend themselves.  If a case\r\nabout this got to court, we can point to that symbol as evidence that\r\nthe plug-in developer understood that the license had this requirement","risk":0,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"b03b13c2-40fa-4475-a652-57be157386b0"}
