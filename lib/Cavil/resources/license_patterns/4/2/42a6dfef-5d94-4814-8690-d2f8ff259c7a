Many of our most important programs do\r\nnot come with free reference manuals and free introductory texts.\r\nDocumentation is an essential part of any software package; when an\r\nimportant free software package does not come with a free manual and a\r\nfree tutorial, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.\r\n\r\n   Consider Perl, for instance.  The tutorial manuals that people\r\nnormally use are non-free.  How did this come about?  Because the\r\nauthors of those manuals published them with restrictive terms--no\r\ncopying, no modification, source files not available--which exclude them\r\nfrom the free software world.\r\n\r\n   That wasn't the first time this sort of thing happened, and it was\r\nfar from the last.  Many times we have heard a GNU user eagerly describe\r\na manual that he is writing, his intended contribution to the community,\r\nonly to learn that he had ruined everything by signing a publication\r\ncontract to make it non-free.\r\n\r\n   Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not\r\nprice.  The problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers\r\ncharge a price for printed copies--that in itself is fine.  (The Free\r\nSoftware Foundation sells printed copies of manuals, too.)  The problem\r\nis the restrictions on the use of the manual.  Free manuals are\r\navailable in source code form, and give you permission to copy and\r\nmodify.  Non-free manuals do not allow this.\r\n\r\n   The criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for\r\nfree software.  Redistribution (including the normal kinds of commercial\r\nredistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can accompany\r\nevery copy of the program, both on-line and on paper.\r\n","risk":0,"spdx":"","trademark":0,"unique_id":"42a6dfef-5d94-4814-8690-d2f8ff259c7a"}
